capitalize, math and encryption are 3 services provided by the server.
which service the client wants to avail, can avail.

steps to run the program -> ./supserver , ./client
the server reads from config file.

the client then gives a port number, the file path associated with that port number is then exec by server.
in the file path, there is a C program, which takes the input in the following way: 

Client side: After the connection is made, the client takes the input from command line .
             now client_sfd communicates with server_nsfd, as the server is waiting for it

Server Side: now the server dups the nsfds to STDIN and STDOUT, the program which has been "execv"ed,
             the input and output from STDIN,STDOUT which is basically nsfds.
